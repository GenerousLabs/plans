# FamilyPlan

## What is it?
FamilyPlan is a platform for discovering and sharing access to software in your network.

Many popular online streaming services (Spotify, Netflix, Apple Music etc.) offer Family Plan options (one bill is paid for multiple accounts, at a much cheaper per-account price). Many other software services (e.g. [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network), [photo and video editing software](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html)) provide extra licenses which can be used on other devices. Many people want to share these extra accounts, and many would love to receive them, and our goal is to put those two groups together.

FamilyPlan is the first step in our mission to make the world a more open and generous place.

## How does it work?
If you want to find people to share with you're a 'Sharer'. Just sign in, create a new offer, and respond to applications as you receive them.
If you want to find someone who's sharing you're a 'Joiner'. Just just sign in, request access to an offer someone else has made, and wait to hear from them. 
If a request is accepted and the conditions are met (other access provided, money changing hands etc), then the account details are revealed to the 'joiner'.

# Generous Labs

## Who are we?
A group of like-minded, strong-willing, and optimistic techies who believe that the battle for our online lives is yet to be won. We're a group of developers, designers, and product people who have given up successful careers to try to build something which might just change the world.

## Our Mission
To make the world a more open, generous place.
Bringing about transformational change in the way we interact online. From a centralised, extractive, transactional model, to a decentralised, regenerative, generous model.

## Our Vision
A world which has moved beyond scarcity and beyond capitalism, where our digital lives are focused on sharing first and transacting second, where people like you and I can connect, interact, and share in whatever way feels good and right to us.
